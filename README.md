# SQL and PowerBI Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my SQL and PowerBI Data Analysis project! This repository showcases my skills in data analysis using SQL on MSSQL and data visualization using PowerBI.

## Project Overview

### Description
This project involves analyzing a dataset using SQL on MSSQL and creating visualizations in PowerBI. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and present them in an easily interpretable format using interactive dashboards.

### Tools Used
- **SQL (MSSQL)**: For data querying and analysis
- **PowerBI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation

### Usage

#### SQL Data Analysis
1. Navigate to the `SQL` folder.
2. Open the `data_analysis.sql` script in your MSSQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
3. Execute the script to perform data analysis and extract insights.

#### PowerBI Visualization
1. Navigate to the `PowerBI` folder.
2. Open the `data_visualization.pbix` file in PowerBI Desktop.
3. Explore the interactive dashboards and visualizations to gain insights from the analyzed data.

## Project Details

### SQL Data Analysis
The SQL script performs various data analysis tasks, including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Aggregating and summarizing data
- Identifying trends and patterns
- Generating insights based on the analysis

### PowerBI Visualization
The PowerBI file contains interactive dashboards that visualize the insights extracted from the data. The visualizations include:
- Bar charts
- Line graphs
- Pie charts
- Interactive filters and slicers

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to perform data analysis using SQL and create insightful visualizations using PowerBI. The combination of SQL and PowerBI allows for powerful data manipulation and presentation, making it easier to derive and communicate actionable insights.
